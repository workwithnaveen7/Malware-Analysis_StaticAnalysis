# Malware-Analysis

I conducted static malware analysis on a real-life malware sample. I have provided the malware file I used, but please do not download it for your safety. If you must download it, only do so in an isolated environment, such as a virtual machine. Additionally, I have provided a PDF file showing the malware analysis.

I created a malware analysis sandbox using REMnux. In this project, I performed basic malware analysis, reverse-engineered the malware using Ghidra, checked whether the file is flagged as malware using VirusTotal, and decoded the hash found in the malware file.
